# Algorithms and Data Structures I

These are my assignments for the Algorithms and Data Structures I course ([SCC0202](https://uspdigital.usp.br/jupiterweb/obterDisciplina?nomdis=&sgldis=SCC0202)) at ICMC-USP.

### Includes
- Exercises using various data structures and abstract data types, including lists (linked and sequential), stack, queue and binary trees;
- Implementations of a [skiplist](/proj1/) (for a dictionary ADT), a [treap](/proj2/) and a [left-leaning redâ€“black](/proj3/) (LLRB).
